A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Word Frequency Counter Using Binary Search Tree (BST)

## 1. Problem Statement

Counting the frequency of words in a paragraph manually is time-consuming, especially when the paragraph contains repeated words. The purpose of this project is to develop a C++ program that automatically counts the occurrences of each word using a Binary Search Tree (BST). The program processes the paragraph, removes punctuation, converts words to lowercase, and displays each unique word along with its frequency in alphabetical order.

## 2. Aim

To develop a C++ program to count the frequency of words in a paragraph using a Binary Search Tree.

## 3. Objectives

- To accept a paragraph as input from the user.
- To extract individual words from the paragraph.
- To remove punctuation and non-alphanumeric characters.
- To convert words to lowercase for consistent counting.
- To store words and their frequencies using a Binary Search Tree.
- To display unique words and their frequencies in alphabetical order.

## 4. Theory

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure in which each node contains data and pointers to its left and right child nodes. In this project, each node stores a word, its frequency, and pointers to its left and right children.

When a word is inserted into the BST, it is compared with the word stored in the current node. If the word already exists, its frequency is incremented. If the word is alphabetically smaller, it is inserted into the left subtree; otherwise, it is inserted into the right subtree.

The program uses the `iostream` library for input and output operations, the `string` library for handling text, the `sstream` library for extracting words, and the `cctype` library for character checking and lowercase conversion.

Recursion is used for inserting words into the tree and displaying the results. The program performs an in-order traversal, visiting the left subtree, the current node, and the right subtree. This displays the words in alphabetical order.

## 5. Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Initialize an empty Binary Search Tree.
3. Accept a paragraph from the user.
4. Extract individual words using a string stream.
5. Remove non-alphanumeric characters from each word.
6. Convert each word to lowercase.
7. Check whether the cleaned word is empty.
8. If the word is not empty, insert it into the BST.
9. If the word already exists, increment its frequency.
10. If the word is smaller than the current node's word, insert it into the left subtree; otherwise, insert it into the right subtree.
11. Repeat the process until all words are processed.
12. Perform an in-order traversal of the BST.
13. Display each word and its frequency.
14. Stop the program.

## 7. Conclusion

The Word Frequency Counter using a Binary Search Tree was implemented in C++. The program counts the occurrences of unique words in a paragraph, ignores differences in letter case, removes punctuation, and displays the results in alphabetical order. This project demonstrates the practical application of binary search trees, recursion, string processing, and tree traversal in solving a text-processing problem.
